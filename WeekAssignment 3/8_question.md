## Question 8

Note that the number of rows is the first element of the shape tuple.

Solution:
A tuple in Numpy that contains the number of elements along each dimension serves as a representation of an array's or matrix's shape. 
For instance, the shape tuple for a matrix with three rows and four columns would be (3, 4). 
The number of rows and columns make up the first and second elements of the tuple, respectively. 
As a result, we only need to read the first element of the array or matrix to get the number of rows in a matrix using .shape.
