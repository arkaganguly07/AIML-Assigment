"""
Explanation:
ðŸŽ± This code first calculates the lowest marks for each student using the min() function, 
and then counts the number of subjects in which the student got the lowest marks using the apply() function. It then 
uses the loc[] function to get the names and IDs of the students who got the lowest marks in more than 2 subjects.
